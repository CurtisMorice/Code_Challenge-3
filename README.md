# Overview
For today's code challenge, you will be creating an Angular application that displays a list of students when a user clicks on the "Display Students" button. To get started, **fork** this repository and `npm install`.

# Baseline
When the page first loads, the user sees a "Display Students" button, but it has no functionality!

## TODO
When the "Display Students" button is clicked, display the array of Antares students as a list (i.e. use `<li>` to display each student).

**IMPORTANT:** Look at the comments in *index.html* and *client.js* to see where to write your code. You should only modify code in these two files.

It will look like [this mockup](https://ninjastorage.blob.core.windows.net/html/M9FLD/index.html#a6dc2c72-7210-8348-3a96-b0b0ec3434ef). Don't worry about centering the list.
