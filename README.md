# Overview
For today's code challenge, you will be creating an Angular application that retrieves a list of students from your server and displays them on the page for the user to view.

# Baseline
When the page first loads, the user sees a "Display Students" button, but it has no functionality!

## TODO
When the "Display Students" button is clicked, call a function on your controller to fetch the list of students using the `$http` service to make a `GET /rho` request and display it in a list on the page. 

It will look like [this mockup](https://ninjastorage.blob.core.windows.net/html/M9FLD/index.html#a6dc2c72-7210-8348-3a96-b0b0ec3434ef).

# Fancy Pants
If you have time and you want to stretch yourself a bit, try the following.

## TODO
Move your `$http` call into a service. Call that service from your controller.
